\section{Bibliography}

Using \texttt{biblatex} you can display bibliography divided into sections, depending of citation type.
Let's cite! The Einstein's journal paper \cite{einstein} and the Dirac's book \cite{dirac} are physics related items.
Next, \textit{The \LaTeX\ Companion} book, the Donald Knuth's website \cite{knuthwebsite}, \textit{The Comprehensive Tex Archive Network} (CTAN) are \LaTeX\ related items; but the others Donald Knuth's items \cite{knuth-fa} are dedicated to programming.
